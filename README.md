### Objective

Implement a URL shortening service using Go and any framework.

### Brief

URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://codesubmit.io/library/react and it returns a short URL such as http://short.est/GeAi9K.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **Go**
    -   Framework: **any framework**
    -   Two endpoints are required
        -   /encode - Encodes a URL to a shortened URL
        -   /decode - Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    -   Both endpoints should return JSON
-   There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to make sure that a URL can be encoded to a short URL and the short URL can be decoded to the original URL. **You do not need to persist short URLs to a database. Keep them in memory.**
-   Provide detailed instructions on how to run your assignment in a separate markdown file
-   Provide API tests for both endpoints
